# Bonsai Interview Test

Features Implemented:

 - Organize the shop page for better browsing experience, adding filters for merchants/products.
 - Ability to 'rating' an item. Store which items got liked in the database, retrieve this information.
 - Searching for product by name/merchant.
 - Add loading-images so the screen isn't empty while data is loading. Add page visits to the database in a meaningful way.
